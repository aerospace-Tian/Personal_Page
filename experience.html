					<h2>Student Research Assistant - Environmental Monitoring Robots</h2>
					<h3>Assistant Professorship of eAviation</h3>
					<p>
						Inspired by natural perching behaviors, I completed the design, manufacturing, and testing of a multimodal aerial robot system to enhance environmental monitoring. The drone features a tensile perching mechanism for energy conservation and a suspended actuated pod for comprehensive data collection. Overcoming challenges in stability and control, we refined the design through iterative testing. The resulting system offers improved efficiency for long-term monitoring tasks and was accepted for presentation at IEEE ICRA 2024. A more advanced version is under review by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. I appreciate my co-authors for their valuable feedback and guidance during the project's development.</p>

					<h2>Internship - Additive Manufacturing in Aviation</h2>
					<h3>Lufthansa Technik AG</h3>
					<p>At Lufthansa Technik's Additive Manufacturing Center, I am responsible for the design and production of 3D-printed components, going through the entire process from initial concept to final post-processing. This includes preparing detailed 3D models, selecting appropriate print materials and methods, and overseeing the printing process to ensure accuracy and quality. I work with departments to identify areas where 3D printing solutions can improve the efficiency of equipment and develop customized components to improve performance and reduce costs. In addition, I am involved in projects that focus on developing specialized 3D printing tools to improve aircraft maintenance processes. The supportive and collaborative atmosphere of Lufthansa Technik's Additive Manufacturing Center has been an important part of my work.</p>

					<h2>Structural Engineer - eVTOL</h2>
					<h3>HORYZN</h3>
					<p>At HORYZN, I was involved in the manufacturing process of the eVTOL wing structure for a groundbreaking project to rapidly deliver defibrillators in Germany. This included mastering the intricacies of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) manufacturing to ensure the wing was lightweight yet strong. I worked closely with a cross-functional team to seamlessly integrate the structural components to improve the overall performance of the aircraft. Our combined efforts culminated in the development of an eVTOL, which is capable of delivering a defibrillator much faster than traditional methods, potentially tripling patient survival. the synergy and dedication of the HORYZN team was instrumental in overcoming the challenges and achieving our ambitious goals.</p>

					<h2>Mechanical Engineer - Payload Design</h2>
					<h3>Scientific Workgroup for Rocketry and Spaceflight (WARR) - Robotics</h3>

					<p> 
						This project contributed to the exploration of solar sintering technology for local soils to build lunar habitats using a sustainable lunar landing robot equipped with a unique solar concentrating lens. I was involved in all phases of the project regarding the experimental payload, including design, construction, manufacturing and testing. The team successfully demonstrated the robot's capabilities during the IGLUNA 2021 field campaign organized by the Swiss Space Agency and the European Space Agency in Lucerne. Worked closely with the WARR team to combine various expertise to drive the project to success.

					<h2>Internship - Additive Manufacturing for Satellites</h2>
					<h3>Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA)</h3>
					<p>At the Fraunhofer Institute, I am involved in a project to design lightweight, cost-effective components for future Constellation satellites using additive manufacturing (AM) technology. I developed and built test prototypes using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and novel materials. The final prototype resulted in significant weight and cost savings, highlighting the potential of 3D printing in aerospace applications. Throughout the project, my close collaboration with my mentor created a productive environment that both enhanced the research results and deepened my understanding of the practical applications of AM.</p>
